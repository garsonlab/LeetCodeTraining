 * Testcase Example:  '[-10,-3,0,5,9]'
 *
 * Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order,
 * convert it to a height balanced BST.
 * 
 * For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree
 * in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more
 * than 1.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
 * 
 * One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following
 * height balanced BST:
 * 
 * ⁠     0
 * ⁠    / \
 * ⁠  -3   9
 * ⁠  /   /
 * ⁠-10  5
